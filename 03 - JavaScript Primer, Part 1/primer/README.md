## Javascript types

#### JavaScript have six built-in types included:

1. number
2. string
3. null: used to indicate a nonexistent or invalid reference.
4. undefined: variable has been defined but not been assigned a value.
5. boolean
6. symbol: used to represent unique constant values, such as **keys** in collections.

> In JavaScript, values have types, not variables.
> The value of this is based on how the function is invoked.

## Understanding Javascript Object inheritance

JavaScript objects have a link to another object, known as _prototype_, where they inherit properties and methods.

## Strict mode

When you enable "strict mode" mean you disable or restrict features that have historically caused poor-quality software.
Eg. The default value for **this** keyword is **undefined** to prevent accident use of the **global** object.

- **Note**: The TypeScript compiler provides a feature for automatically enabling strict mode in Javascript code it generates.
