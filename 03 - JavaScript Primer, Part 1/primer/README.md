## Javascript types

#### JavaScript have six built-in types included:

1. number
2. string
3. null: used to indicate a nonexistent or invalid reference.
4. undefined: variable has been defined but not been assigned a value.
5. boolean
6. symbol: used to represent unique constant values, such as **keys** in collections.

> In JavaScript, values have types, not variables.
> The value of this is based on how the function is invoked.

JavaScript objects have a link to another object, known as _prototype_, where they inherit properties and methods.
